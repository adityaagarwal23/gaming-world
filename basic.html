	    	<h2 align="center">FPS Shooting </h2>
	    	<br>
	    	<h3>Here are some best FPS Shooting games :</h3>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li><b>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\codblack.jpg" width="600">
	    		<p>It's a solid, exciting campaign with some interesting twists and turns, a trippy ending(s) and some cool puzzles to solve. The game takes place in the 1980s. This trip is not a departure from the high-octane, set-piece-powered experiences we have seen before. But it does have enough narrative surprises and experimental scenes to satisfy the twisted, intriguing storytelling history of the Black Ops series. Unlike last year's Modern Warfare reboot, which borrowed the muted and obscure undertones of wartime thrillers such as Zero Dark Thirty, Black Ops does its part to combine various pop culture elements that were successful in the Cold War 1980s. Reminiscent of an action movie inspired by the decade. The same result as when the Call of Duty is available is closer to a James Bond-style campaign.</p>
	    		<br>
	    		<li><b>Doom Eternal</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\Doom-Eternal-1.jpg" width="600">
	    		<p>In 1999, Doom set the standard for early FPS gaming. 21 years later, and people in ID software are showing everyone how to do it. Chaotic, fast and brutal - eternal is doomed. The game rewards courage and skill and punishes recklessness and player error, never giving up (unlike the occasional magic of platforming). Matching the over-the-top gameplay is the heavy metal soundtrack, which won the award-winning **** Gordon (who brought his soundtrack to the original Doom soundtrack and cried at the 2016 Game Awards). Doom Eternal is also one of the best games currently available on the Xbox Game Pass.</p>
	    		<br>
	    		<li><b>Far Cry 5</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\farcry.jpg" width="600">
	    		<p>Far Cry is known for dragging its protagonists into troubled exotic locations, with the fifth installment of the series taking place in the middle of the United States. The fictional kingdom in Hope County, Montana, is in the oppressive grip of a Doomsday witch who violently brainwashes local communities, not adoring their psychic leader Joseph Seed. The story is great, Far Cry 5's special features are beautiful landscapes and stunning, sophisticated gunplay. The arsenal is wide and varied, allowing players to experiment and freestyle with new strategies. Easily one, if not the best, open-world FPS game available today. We hope that Far Cry 6 will be able to maximize its success when it is released later this year.</p>
	    		<br>
	    		<li><b>Call of Duty: Warzone</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\codwarzone.jpg" width="600">
	    		<p>The battle is no less than a royal style attack monument. It is responsible for attracting FPS fans from more traditional shooter titles and into the vast, open world maps with tens and tens of hostels ... for free. It is not surprising that Activision took notice from behind Modern Warfare (2019) and launched Warzone in response to the trend. Up to 150 players can compete in a single match, each with a bet for survival. Not to be missed is the ability to experience the precise and visceral mechanics of Call of Duty.</p>
	    		<br>
	    		<li><b>Apex Legends</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\apexlegend.jpg" width="600">
	    		<p>Apex Legends is one of the many war royal titles that have emerged in recent years. Very few have received much praise, or have not been so consistent. It features quick-fire gunplay and epic, ever-evolving maps (including the supernatural for Titanfall veterans), goofy character designs, and a thriving online community. It's free to download, but special editions are available through retailers such as Amazon, offering exclusive skins and weapons.</p>

	    	<h2 align="center">Real-time strategy (RTS) </h2>
	    	<br>
	    	<h3>Here are some real-time strategy games :</h3>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li><b>Total War: Three kingdoms</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\totalwar3.jpg" width="600">
	    		<p>The latest historical entry in this series takes some hints from Warhamer, which you will find elsewhere in this list, giving us an extensive Chinese Civil War inspired by the battlefield and its diverse characters. Each is part of a web of complex relationships that affects everything from diplomacy to performance in combat, and they are all superhuman warriors like their Warhammer counterparts. Rome seems to have moved forward for this series in the same way it has done in the past, bringing about some fundamental changes on how diplomacy, trade and war work. The fight against China also makes for compelling propaganda, which has been blessed with a kind of dynamism we have never seen in Total War before. Since its inception, it has also benefited from some great DLC, including a new format that includes historical bookmarks that extend over various events from the era.</p>
	    		<br>
	    		<li><b>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\warhammer.jpg" width="600">
	    		<p>In the complete darkness of the distant future, there is only war. Experience every **** - Warâ€Œhammer 40,000 amazing blast and soul-crushing charge: Battle sector, the perfect battle-level game of turn-based strategy and fast combat that takes you into the 41st millennium battlefield. Experience the legendary Twenty Mission Single Player campaign that explores after the destruction of the ball.</p>
	    		<br>
	    		<li><b>Gear Tactics</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\gear.jpg" width="600">
	    		<p>Mainline Gears of War games are cover-based shooters that put you in the shoes of muscle soldiers who protect humanity from mutation groups called locusts. Amazingly, Xbox Game Studios Gears Tactics-turn-based, strategic style preserves many features of the series, including the franchise's first venture-wild melee, cover-heavy atmospheres and waves of ultra-aggressive enemies. Action points, travel lines, range cones and the ability to recruit new troops give the game its tactical elements. The cheap germination of the enemy brings moments of despair.</p>
	    		<br>
	    		<li><b>Clash Royal</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\clash.jpg" width="600">
	    		<p>Clash Royale pitches you in card-based duels against players around the world. The gameplay loop at the Royals is tougher than its sister game and focusing on doubles on long-term missions makes it a perfect game for pickup matches. Part Card Game and Part Tower Defense, Clash Royale involves two players in a duel with each other. Rounds are intense and different unit types have obvious strengths and weaknesses that provide quick adjustments to enemy tactics. There is also a small but dedicated sports community in this sport if you are interested in some competitive sport.</p>
	    		<br>
	    		<li><b>Stellaris</b></li>
	    		<br>
	    		<img src="photosss\Stellaris.jpg" width="400" height="350">
	    		<p>The Stellaris Space 4X takes on an 'all and kitchen sink' approach. It contains a dose of EU4, the grand strategy game of paradox, but applied to a sci-fi game that includes everything from robotic uprisings to aliens living in black holes. It undoubtedly tries to do a lot and does not focus on the greats of some other genre, but nothing comes close to being a celebration of interstellar science fiction. It is a liberating sandbox designed to guide your species and empire through the stars, interfering with their genetic code, enslaving aliens or exploiting the galaxy in the form of bees inhabiting the galaxy.</p>
